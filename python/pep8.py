    What is PEP8?

    Before we answer that question, let's begin with: What is PEP?

    PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.

    "A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community,
    or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment.
    The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature."

    PEP8 is Python's style guide, a coding convention* with recommendations, but not mandatory.

    Every Python developer is free to choose their own style, but PEP8, and consistency
    are highly recommended. Particularly when sharing your code publicly or working with others.

    * this convention changes with time!

    Why is this needed?
        - Consistency (By importance: module -> project -> generic)
        - Readability ("Code is read much more often than it is written")
        - Compatibility

    PEP8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
    PEP20: https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/ (The Zen of Python)

    Any code written here is just for a visual reminder of its implementation.
