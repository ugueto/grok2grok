## Problems

In the following folder you may find many data structure & algorithm problems.
In the first line of each file, I will add a comment with:

- Tags (related to the problem)
- Problem statement
- Explained solution: 
    1. Approach / First thoughts
    2. Initial solution / brute force
    3. BUD (Bottlenecks, Unnecessary, Duplicate)
    4. Testing
    5. Final solution

After this, you will find my proposed solution, always in Python.
