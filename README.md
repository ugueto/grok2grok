# grok2grok

**__grok2grok__** is about learning to learn, about being consistent and thorough.

It's not about cracking the code interview, nor about Leetcode, it's about __understanding__ and improving.

This is my repository for Python mastery and dealing with code interviews.
The goal is not to pass them, but to become a better problem solver and improve as an engineer so that I can easily navigate them (and real work scenarios).

Everything in this repo will be written in **Python**.

You may find external resources in each folder's own README.

> *DISCLAIMER*: This repo is built for my own learning purposes, there might be technical or conceptual errors as I am not an expert in any of these subjects.
