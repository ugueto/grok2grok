# grok2grok
It's not about cracking the code interview, nor about Leetcode, it's about understanding and improving.

grok2grok is my repository for dealing with code interviews.
The plan is not to pass them, but to improve as an engineer so that I can easily navigate them (and real work scenarios).

Everything in this repo will be written in Python.

*DISCLAIMER*: This repo is built for my own learning purposes, there might be technical or conceptual errors as I am not an expert in any of these subjects.
