## Data Structures

In this folder you may find the following concepts applied in Python:

1. Arrays (lists) - built-in
2. HashMaps (dicts) - built-in
3. Tuples - built-in
4. Sets - built-in
5. Stacks
6. Linked Lists (w/ Nodes, Doubly Linked Lists, and more fun stuff!)
7. Trees (w/ Tries, Binary Trees or does that go with Graphs?)
8. Queues
9. Heaps
10. Graphs

We will also learn how to create, delete, insert, and locate elements in these data structures.
Armed with this knowledge, we will be able to decide when to properly apply them.
